    "Of course, in reality, a system never changes infinitely quickly. However, there are cases where the change in the Hamiltonian associated with a system is much faster than the relaxation time of the system. A typical example is radioactive decay, wherein the identity of an atomic nucleus changes on a timescale that is, from the viewpoint of the electrons in the system, nearly instantaneous. \n",
